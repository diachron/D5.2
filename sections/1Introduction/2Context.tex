\subsection{Context of this Document}
\label{sec:ContextDoc} 

\todo{CL: my first shot; improvised w/o looking into previous deliverables; need to verify against them}The overall architecture of Diachron, as outlined in Deliverable 6.1~\todo{CL: add to bibtex}\cite{diachron-d6.1}, comprises services that access and operate on diachronic data, as well as pilot applications that solve domain-specific problems and make use of the services to handle data specific to these problems.  An initial specification of the interfaces of these services – RESTful web services that speak JSON, to be exact – has also been provided in Deliverable 6.1.  Here, we describe the \emph{implementation} of the \emph{quality assessment service} and explain, in a generic, domain-independent way, how to use it to assess the quality of data.

The concrete quality metrics that we have so far implemented within our quality assessment framework, and which the service can compute for any given dataset, follow the definitions from Deliverable 5.1~\cite{diachron-d5.1}.
We \todo{CL@JD: This is a bit fuzzy, but we didn't implement all of them, did we?}prioritised the implementation of those metrics that Deliverable 5.1 identified relevant to Diachron~\cite[section~4]{diachron-d5.1}.

\todo{CL@JD: We are completely ignoring the tool survey from \cite[section~5]{diachron-d5.1}.  Should we say something that we didn't find any of the existing tools suitable because …?}
