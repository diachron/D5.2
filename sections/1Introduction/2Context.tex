\subsection{Context of this Document}
\label{sec:ContextDoc} 

\todo{CL: my first shot; improvised w/o looking into previous deliverables; need to verify against them}The overall architecture of Diachron, as outlined in Deliverable 6.1~\todo{CL: add to bibtex}\cite{diachron-d6.1}, comprises services that access and operate on diachronic data, as well as pilot applications that solve domain-specific problems and make use of the services to handle data specific to these problems.  An initial specification of the interfaces of these services – RESTful web services that speak JSON, to be exact – has also been provided in Deliverable 6.1.  Here, we describe the \emph{implementation} of the \emph{quality assessment service} and explain, in a generic, domain-independent way, how to use it to assess the quality of data.
