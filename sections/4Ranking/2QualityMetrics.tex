%Introduction
In this subsection we describe the metrics implemented as at the deliverable's deadline which are included in the first prototype of this service.
For this purpose, those metrics which are required by the pilot partners (cf. D5.1) were analysed and prioritised accordingly, also keeping in mind metrics required by the cleaning application discussed in D3.2
Each implemented metric is expected to conform to the interface described in Section~\ref{sec:processingUnit}.
