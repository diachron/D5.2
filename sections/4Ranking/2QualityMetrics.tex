\subsection{Data Quality Metrics}
\label{sec:DQMetrics} 
In this subsection we describe the metrics implemented as of the deliverable's deadline which are included in the first prototype of this service.
For this purpose, those metrics which are generally required by DIACHRON (\textbf{GEN}) and those specific by the pilot partners (Data Publica – \textbf{DP};  Scientific Pilot – \textbf{EBI}; cf. Deliverable 5.1~\cite[section 4]{diachron-d5.1}) were analysed and prioritised accordingly, also keeping in mind metrics required by the cleaning application discussed in Deliverable 3.2~\cite{diachron-d3.2}.
Some pilot partners required custom metrics (such as checking for a specific property) to be implemented.
These will be identified with a $\star$.
Each implemented metric is expected to conform to the interface described in Section~\ref{sec:processingUnit}.
