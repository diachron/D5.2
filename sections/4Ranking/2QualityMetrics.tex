%Introduction
In this subsection we describe the metrics implemented as at the deliverable's deadline which are included in the first prototype of this service.
For this purpose, those metrics which are required overall by DIACHRON (\textbf{ALL}) and those specific by the pilot partners (Data Publica - \textbf{DP};  Scientific Pilot - \textbf{EBI}; cf. D5.1 - Section 4) were analysed and prioritised accordingly, also keeping in mind metrics required by the cleaning application discussed in D3.2.
Some pilot partners required custom metrics (eg. checking for an additional property) to be implemented.
These will be identified with a $\star$.
Each implemented metric is expected to conform to the interface described in Section~\ref{sec:processingUnit}.
