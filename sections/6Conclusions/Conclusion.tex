\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:Conclusion} 

This document describes the software prototype for crawling, ranking and appraisal services which is required as part of the DoW in M16 of the project.
It provides a detailed high level description on the Quality Assessment Framework (Section~\ref{sec:HLA}), which provides the basis of this prototype.

During the initial phase, pilot partners identified the required metrics for their use cases (cf. Deliverable 5.1~\cite{diachron-d5.1}).
Having these in mind, a framework was identified to facilitate the quality assessment of the pilots' datasets together with providing enough metadata to enable the crawling and ranking of these datasets.
After describing the Quality Assessment framework, Assessment and Ranking services were describe in Section~\ref{sec:Ranking} whilst Crawling services were described in Section~\ref{sec:CrawlingService}.
\todo{CL: Can't say ``runnable'' unless you put a downloadable executable file there}The sources of the prototype of the assessment framework can be found at \url{https://github.com/diachron/quality}\footnote{Please note that this URL can change without any notice.}.

The approach taken in the QA framework is a generic pluggable approach, therefore it can be used even beyond the scope of DIACHRON.
Additionally, a number of research tasks were also addressed in the framework, particularly the representation of quality metadata.
